I recently joined a company called [SNC Lavalin](http://www.snclavalin.com/en/) as a Data Engineer. And this field is completely new to me.
So I did a little bit of homework so that I can start picking up things and actively contribute to the upcoming projects.

#### Blogs

I have always found blogs to be incredibly useful in building up knowledge in any new domain.
